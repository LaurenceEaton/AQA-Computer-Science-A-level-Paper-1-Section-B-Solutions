Write a program that gets two words from the user and then displays a message
saying if the first word can be created using the letters from the second word or not.
For example:
• The word EAT can be formed from the word ATE as the first word uses one E, one
A and one T and the second word also contains one of each of these letters.
• The word EAT can be formed from the word HEART as the second word contains
one E, one A and one T which are the letters needed to form the first word.
• The word TO can be formed from the word POSITION as the second word contains
one T and (at least) one O which are the letters needed to form the first word.
• The word MEET cannot be formed from the word MEAT as the second word only
contains one E and two Es are needed to form the first word.
You may assume that the user will only enter words that consist of upper case letters
