Write a program that gets the user to enter a string. It should keep getting the user to
enter a string until they enter a valid string. Each time they enter a string an
appropriate message should be displayed telling them whether the string they entered
is valid or not.
For a string to be valid:
• it must be between five and seven characters in length (inclusive)
• it must consist only of uppercase letters
• it must contain only unique characters (ie no character appears in the string more
than once)
• the sum of the ASCII codes of the characters in the string must be between 420
and 600 (inclusive).
