One method that can be used to compress text data is run length encoding
(RLE). When RLE is used the compressed data can be represented as a set of
character/frequency pairs. When the same character appears in consecutive
locations in the original text it is replaced in the compressed text by a single
instance of the character followed by a number indicating the number of
consecutive instances of that character. Single instances of a character are
represented by the character followed by the number 1.
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show examples of how text would be compressed using
this method.
Figure 9
Original text: AAARRRRGGGHH
Compressed text: A 3 R 4 G 3 H 2
Figure 10
Original text: CUTLASSES
Compressed text: C 1 U 1 T 1 L 1 A 1 S 2 E 1 S 1
What you need to do
Task 1
Write a program that will perform the compression process described above.
The program should display a suitable prompt asking the user to input the text to
compress and then output the compressed text.
Task 2
Test the program works by entering the text AAARRRRGGGHH.
Task 3
Test the program works by entering the text A.
